abstract = {This paper introduces an approach to control of physics-based characters based on high-level features of movement, such as center-of-mass, angular momentum, and end-effectors. Objective terms are used to control each feature, and are combined by a prioritization algorithm. We show how locomotion can be expressed in terms of a small number of features that control balance and end-effectors. This approach is used to build controllers for human balancing, standing jump, and walking. These controllers provide numerous benefits: human-like qualities such as arm-swing, heel-off, and hip-shoulder counter-rotation emerge automatically during walking; controllers are robust to changes in body parameters; control parameters and goals may be modified at run-time; control parameters apply to intuitive properties such as center-of-mass height; and controllers may be mapped onto entirely new bipeds with different topology and mass distribution, without modifications to the controller itself. No motion capture or off-line optimization process is used.},

abstract = { One step on the way to approach human performance in robotics is to provide joint torque sensing and control for better interaction capabilities with the environment, and a large number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs) for improved versatility. However, the increasing complexity also raises the question of how to resolve the kinematic redundancy which is a direct consequence of the large number of DOFs. Here we give an overview of the most practical and frequently used torque control solutions based on null space projections. Two fundamental structures of task hierarchies are reviewed and compared, namely the successive and the augmented method. Then the projector itself is investigated in terms of its consistency. We analyze static, dynamic, and the new concept of stiffness consistency. In the latter case, stiffness information is used in the pseudoinversion instead of the inertia matrix. In terms of dynamic consistency, we generalize the weighting matrix from the classical operational space approach and show that an infinite number of weighting matrices exist to obtain dynamic consistency. In this context we also analyze another dynamically consistent null space projector with slightly different structure and properties. The redundancy resolutions are finally compared in several simulations and experiments. A thorough discussion of the theoretical and empirical results completes this survey. }
